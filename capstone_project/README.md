# Capstone Project: Community Data Analysis Collaboration

## Overview

The capstone project for our data analytics course offers a practical, hands-on experience where students collaborate with local businesses or non-profits to provide data analysis services. This project is designed to help students apply their skills in a real-world setting while delivering valuable insights to their community partners. Students will work on analyzing a set of data provided by the business or non-profit, which could be used for an annual report, strategic planning, or creating a dashboard for ongoing data tracking.

## Project Process

  - [ ] **Project Introduction:**  
   Each student will identify and reach out to a local business or non-profit organization to offer their data analysis services. This will involve an interview with the client to understand the data needs of the organization and decide on a project that could help them make data-driven decisions. This will be introduced during a class session where students can discuss their potential projects and approach.

  - [ ]  **Project Execution:**  
   Once the business or non-profit agrees, students will collect the relevant data and begin their analysis. This phase should take approximately two weeks, during which students will apply the skills learned in the course, including data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

- [ ]  **Presentation:**  
   After completing the analysis, students will set up a call with the business or non-profit to present their findings. The presentation should include a clear explanation of the analysis performed, key insights, and any visualizations created (such as dashboards or charts).

- [ ]  **Feedback and Refinement:**  
   Following the presentation, students will gather feedback from the organization. If any adjustments or refinements are needed, students will have a short period to make these changes and deliver the final product.

## Project Goals

- To provide students with a practical, real-world experience of working with data in a professional setting.
- To help local businesses or non-profits make better use of their data, enhancing their operations or reporting capabilities.
- To build students' confidence in presenting their work and responding to client feedback.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, students will have completed a full data analysis project from start to finish, gained experience in client communication, and learned how to adapt their work based on feedback. The capstone project serves as an excellent portfolio piece and prepares students for future roles in data analytics.
