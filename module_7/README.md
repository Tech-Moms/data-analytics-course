**Course**: Data Analytics

**Module**: Intermediate Excel for Data Analytics with Tech-Mom's Data

**Objective**:  
Students will:
- [x] Analyze real-world data from a non-profit organization.
- [x] Apply intermediate Excel functions: **SUMIF**, **XLOOKUP**, and **IF statements**.
- [x] Create charts and pivot tables to visualize non-profit data.
- [x] Reflect on how data analysis can drive decision-making in non-profits.

## Scenario  
The Leadership team is preparing to release their 2024 Tech Moms Survey Report. Survey reports are typically data-driven. They are important for non-profits because they provide transparency and demonstrate impact, which are crucial for sustaining donor support. The team needs to know the updated numbers for their student graduate survey. They share a .csv file titled [Tech-Moms Annual Survey Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rf9-nhBHtUWr0t4c0paNZaaJhFpDMU8lAIbeBR_uk0Q/edit?usp=sharing). The team asks that you analyze the data and provide them with insights into the updated student demographic numbers.

Your deliverable will be a “Student Survey” Dashboard built in the spreadsheet software of your choice - Excel or Google Sheets.

## Instructions for Students

### 1. Get to Know Your Data

- [x] Review the Tech Moms 2024 Annual Survey Report - paying special attention to the Student Demographic sections
- [x] Download the [Tech-Moms Annual Survey Data]
- [x] Open the .csv file in the spreadsheet tool of your choice - Excel or Google Sheets
- [x] Start by evaluating the columns to understand what data you’re working with
- [x] Create a new tab, “Data Dictionary” and copy the columns -> go to new tab -> paste “transposed”. This will paste the columns vertically.
- [x] Add a row at the top of the Data Dictionary tab. In A1, type “Column Column Name” & in B1, type “Column Description”. Write a short description of each column based on your best-educated guess (you can also use ChatGPT to help with this).
- [x] Add a tab “Questions” as you come across questions about the data. You can add them here. These are questions you can ask the data owners (aka leadership team) to help clarify any questions you may have about the data set.

### 2. Review Key Concepts   
Before working with the dataset, review these Excel functions:
- [x] **SUMIF**: Sums values based on a specific condition.
- [x] **XLOOKUP**: Retrieves data from a table based on a lookup value (similar to VLOOKUP but more flexible).
- [x] **IF Statements**: Allows for logical comparisons and returns different values based on whether a condition is met.
- [x] **Pivot Tables**: Helps to summarize and analyze large datasets.

**Resources**:
- [x] Video: [Intermediate Excel for Data Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kghcAk7l6eA).
- [x] Documentation: [XLOOKUP](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/xlookup-function) and [SUMIF](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sumif-function-169b8c99-c05c-4483-a712-1697a653039b).

### 3. Practice with Tech-Moms Survey Data:  
Download the sample dataset . This dataset includes:
- [x] **Student Enrollment**: Number of students per program.
- [x] **Program Outcomes**: Success metrics for each program.

**Tasks**:
1. [x] Use **XLOOKUP** to find which students found the program useful.
2. [x] Apply the **SUMIF** function to calculate total score from students quantive resports.
3. [x] Create an **IF statement** to label programs as "Successful" or "Needs Improvement" based on their outcome scores (e.g., IF score >= 80, then “Successful”).

---

### 4. Create Visualizations   
Create visual representations of the data:
- [x] **Pivot Table**: Summarize the total student responses.
- [x] **Bar Chart**: Compare income amounts by type (e.g. prior income, current income ).
- [x] **Pie Chart**: Visualize the proportion of "Successful" versus "Needs Improvement" areas.

---
### 5: Create Charts & Build a Dashboard

- [x] For each pivot table, create a chart next to it that visually represents the data. It is up to you to decide what chart will convey the data the best.
- [x] Review the Annual Survey Report again and make a list of what was reported.
- [x] Add another tab “Dashboard” and copy & paste the charts you have made in the Dashboard tab.

### 6: Make it Aesthetic

- [x] Evaluate the current dashboard and make some decisions on what would make the dashboard more aesthetically pleasing.
- [x] Create some new columns either in the “analysis” tab or in the “pivot tables” tab to consolidate data into the minimal number of categories in order to best visually represent it in the dashboard.
- [x] Upload the Tech-Moms logo to the dashboard.
- [x] Update the Dashboard theme to use Tech-Moms’ brand colors.

### Last Step: Ship it!

- [x] Write an email to the leadership team (data@tech-moms.org) sharing the updated numbers with a screenshot of the dashboard, along with a URL link and additional questions along with summary insights.
- [x] Do a little happy dance - you’re crushing it!

## Submission Guidelines  
Submit :
- **Excel File**: Include your dataset with XLOOKUP, SUMIF, and IF statements applied, as well as the visualizations.
- **Dashboard**: Include a Dashboard (Word or PDF) containing your data analysis.
