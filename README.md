## Course Structure

The course is structured to combine in-class instruction with hands-on practice. Here’s how we’ll approach learning:

#### In-Class Learning

Each week, we will have interactive lectures and live demonstrations covering key concepts and techniques in data analytics. These sessions will provide you with a thorough understanding of the topics and the opportunity to ask questions and engage in discussions. The main areas we will focus on include:

- **Excel & Google Sheets**: Basic functions and formulas, data import and cleaning, exploratory data analysis, pivot tables, and chart & dashboard creation.
- **SQL**: Querying databases, data manipulation, and advanced SQL techniques.
- **BI Tools**: Creating dashboards and reports using tools like Looker Data Studio, Tableau, and Power BI.

#### Hands-On Practice & Weekly Projects

Learning doesn’t stop at the classroom. Each week, you will be given assignments and projects to work on independently. These activities are designed to reinforce what you’ve learned in class and help you apply these concepts to real-world data problems.

#### Leveraging ChatGPT
To enhance your learning experience, we will leverage ChatGPT as your personal study buddy and data tutor. ChatGPT can assist you with understanding complex concepts, providing instant feedback on your queries, and offering guidance on your assignments and projects. This unique tool will help you navigate the course content and ensure you have support whenever you need it.

#### Using GitHub for Our Class

We will use this GitHub repository to manage our course materials and assignments. Each student will fork (make a copy of) the main course repository to their personal GitHub profile and use that fork to track their weekly assignments. Each week, you will edit the Module README (e.g., Module_1/README.md) in your forked repository and add a checkmark when you have completed each task. Occasionally, you will need to pull in changes from the main course repository to keep your fork updated. 

To do this, you will: 

1) Click "sync fork" at the top of your forked repository.

2) Then "update branch" to pull in the changes from this repo.

This approach will help you build familiarity with GitHub, an essential tool in the developer and data analytics community. Additionally, using GitHub will allow you to showcase your work and track your progress. By regularly updating your repository, you will add daily squares to your GitHub contribution graph, providing a visual representation of your learning streak and progress throughout the course.

#### Capstone Project

Towards the end of the course, you will embark on a capstone project. This will involve working with a local businesses or non-profit to identify their data needs, analyzing their data, and producing a report / dashboard for them. This project will be a culmination of all the skills you’ve acquired and will be a significant addition to your portfolio.

#### Guest Speakers
To provide you with real-world insights and a broader understanding of the data industry, we will occasionally host guest speakers. These speakers will come from various roles such as Business Analysts, Data Analysts, Data Engineers, and Data Team Managers. They will share their experiences and insights, discussing a day in the life of their jobs, the challenges they face, and the skills they use daily. This will give you a clearer picture of the potential career paths in the data field.

## Course Resources

To support your learning, we provide a variety of resources:

- **Lecture Videos**: Available after each class.
- **Video Tutorials**: Recorded sessions and additional tutorials to help you with complex topics.
- **Class Slack**: A place to ask questions, share insights, and collaborate with peers.
- **GitHub Repository**: All course materials, assignments, and projects will be available on our GitHub repository.
