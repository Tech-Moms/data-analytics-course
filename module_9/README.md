# Module 9: Introduction to Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## Module Overview
In this module, students will explore the foundations of Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (ML). Students will learn how ML uses data to make predictions and uncover patterns, the history and evolution of AI, and practical applications of AI tools in modern workflows. They will also gain hands-on experience using AI as a tutor and critiquing it's output compared with using Google or asking a human.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will:

1. Understand the basic concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning
2. Dive into how generative AI works, including large language models (LLMs) and image generation
3. Explore bias, ethics, privacy and the responsible use of AI
4. Touch on real world applications of AI, including computer vision
5. Identify and differentiate between various roles AI can play, such as a tutor and a coach.
6. Recognize key AI tools like Claude, MidJourney, Bing, ChatGPT, and NotebookLM.
7. Critique AI-generated output to assess it's validity, strengths, and weaknesses.

</a>

The most important aspect of Machine Learning is what data is used to train it. Find out how training data affects a machine's predictions and why biased data can lead to biased decisions.

Computer Vision is a form of machine learning used in self-driving cars, facial recognition systems, and sustainable farming. Find out how a computer learns to classify images, how it can build from simple shapes to more complex figures, and why it’s so difficult for a computer to tell the difference between a chihuahua and a muffin.

In this section, you'll learn about neural networks. Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process input data by assigning weights, applying activation functions, and adjusting through training to minimize errors. They learn patterns and make predictions by iteratively updating these weights using algorithms like backpropagation, improving their accuracy over time.
